# leetcode-programming-skills

This repository intends to demonstrate some programming problems using different languages.

## :seedling: Start your Programming Journey

This repository is designed to illustrate the fundamentals of programming. You should learn to programby solving hands-on problems. I aim to provide solutions in the following programming languages:

- Python
- C++

> :orange_book: I hope to add languages such as `OCaml`, `Go-lang`, or `Swift` in the future.

The thought here is simple: nail the basics, and you are well on your way to mastering a language. If you are coming from `Python` or `JavaScript` and curious about `C++`, this is a great place to start!

## Where can I find these problems?
All of these problems are sourced from `leetcode.com`.
