# programming_skills
This repository intends to demonstrate some programming problems using different languages.

# Why does this repository exist?
This repository intends to show the reader how to do basic programming using the following languages:
    - Python
    - C++
    - ???

I figure, if you know how to do these basic problems in a programming language, then you are probably well on your way to learning that language.

Consider this as learning material for those moving from Python//JavaScript to C++.

# Where can I find these problems?
All of these problems are sourced from `leetcode.com`.
