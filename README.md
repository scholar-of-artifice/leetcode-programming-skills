# leetcode-programming-skills

This repository intends to demonstrate some programming problems using different languages.

## :seedling: Start your Programming Journey

This repository is designed to illustrate the fundamentals of programming. You should learn to program by solving hands-on problems. I aim to provide solutions in the following programming languages:

- Python
- C++

> :orange_book: I hope to add languages such as `OCaml`, `Go-lang`, or `Swift` in the future.

The thought here is simple: nail the basics, and you are well on your way to mastering a language. If you are coming from `Python` or `JavaScript` and curious about `C++`, this is a great place to start!

## :compass: Where can I find these problems?
All of these problems are sourced from `leetcode.com`.

## :bust_in_silhouette: Who is this for?

The `programming-skills` study plan on `leetcode` is a great way to build a working proficiency with a given programming language. You should consider doing this study plan if you are:
- new to programming
- picking up a new programming language
- struggling with `easy` leetcode style questions

## :question: Why should I do this?
These are easy questions that are not likely to be interview questions. However, they are the fundamental problems that any programmer should be able to solve. 

By the end of doing this study plan, you will be able to:
- express a data structure
- traverse a data structure
- compute with data



:canoe: I hope the code answers provide help for someone else out there.
